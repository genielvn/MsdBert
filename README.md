# How to use?

## Envs

```
replicated by kimmontana, see requirements.txt
```

## Install

```
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

## Dataset

You can find the Image data from https://github.com/headacheboy/data-of-multimodal-sarcasm-detection.

Put the images under a folder named "Images"

## Train and Test

Train:

```
python run_classifier.py --data_dir ./data/ --image_dir ./images/ --output_dir ./output/MsdBERT_output/  --do_train --do_test --model_select MsdBERT
```

Test:

```
python run_classifier.py --data_dir ./data/ --image_dir ./images/ --output_dir ./output/MsdBERT_output/  --do_test --model_select MsdBERT
```

Run all models recursively:

```
sh run_classifier.sh
```

## Saving

All the models and evaluation results will be saved under the "output" folder.
